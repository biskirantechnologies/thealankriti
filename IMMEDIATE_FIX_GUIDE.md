# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR "BACKEND OFFLINE" ISSUE

## Problem Identified ✅
Your frontend IS deployed at `https://thealankriti-frontend.onrender.com` BUT it's still trying to connect to `localhost:3001` instead of your production backend.

## Root Cause ❌
The `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is NOT set in your Render frontend deployment.

## SOLUTION: Add Environment Variable to Render Frontend

### Step 1: Access Your Render Frontend Service
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://render.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your **"thealankriti-frontend"** static site service
3. Go to **"Environment"** tab in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable
Click **"Add Environment Variable"** and enter:

```
Key: REACT_APP_API_URL
Value: https://thealankriti-backendd.onrender.com/api
```

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend
1. After adding the environment variable, click **"Manual Deploy"** 
2. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Wait for build to complete (~3-5 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify Fix
After deployment, your frontend will connect to the correct backend.

## Alternative: Check render.yaml Configuration

Your `render.yaml` already has the correct configuration:

```yaml
envVars:
  - key: REACT_APP_API_URL
    value: https://thealankriti-backendd.onrender.com/api
```

But Render might not have used this for the frontend service. Manual configuration ensures it works.

## Quick Test Commands

Test the fix with these PowerShell commands:

```powershell
# Test backend (should work)
Invoke-WebRequest "https://thealankriti-backendd.onrender.com/health"

# Test frontend (should work after fix)
Invoke-WebRequest "https://thealankriti-frontend.onrender.com"
```

## What Will Happen After Fix:
- ✅ Admin login will connect to production backend
- ✅ No more CORS errors 
- ✅ No more "backend offline" messages
- ✅ Full website functionality restored

## Expected Timeline:
- Environment variable setup: 2 minutes
- Frontend rebuild: 3-5 minutes
- **Total fix time: ~7 minutes**

---

**The backend has been working perfectly this entire time!** This is just a configuration issue.
